**About Me**

I am a dedicated technical writer interested in software quality and testing. I am passionate about delivering clear, accurate, and user-friendly documentation. I strive to bridge the gap between development, QA, and end-users by ensuring that documentation aligns with both the software's functionality and real-world user needs. In addition to my 18 years of experience as a Technical Writer working in the software industry, I am expanding my skills in software testing, including test automation, to understand product quality better and help create robust, reliable software. I am eager to collaborate with teams to improve test coverage, identify edge cases, and contribute to continuous improvement throughout the product lifecycle. A few of my skills include GitHub, Postman, CircleCI, Stoplight, JIRA, JavaScript, Visual Studio, HTML/CSS, Chrome Dev Tools, SQL, Selenium, and TestRail. 

I approach every project with curiosity, a commitment to quality, and a focus on efficiency, ensuring that each piece of content enhances the user experience. When Iâ€™m not writing, I enjoy baking sourdough bread.

**Overview**

This repository showcases a selection of my technical writing samples from my work at BigCommerce. I chose each piece for its role as a project for which I served as the lead writer.
