**About Me**

I am a dedicated technical writer interested in software quality and testing. I am passionate about delivering clear, accurate, and user-friendly documentation. I strive to bridge the gap between development, QA, and end-users by ensuring that documentation aligns with both the software's functionality and real-world user needs. In addition to my 18 years of experience as a Technical Writer working in the software industry, I am expanding my skills in software testing, including test automation, to understand product quality better and help create robust, reliable software. I am eager to collaborate with teams to improve test coverage, identify edge cases, and contribute to continuous improvement throughout the product lifecycle. A few of my skills include GitHub, Postman, CircleCI, Stoplight, JIRA, JavaScript, Visual Studio, HTML/CSS, Chrome Dev Tools, SQL, Selenium, and TestRail. 

I approach every project with curiosity, a commitment to quality, and a focus on efficiency, ensuring that each piece of content enhances the user experience. When Iâ€™m not writing, I enjoy baking sourdough bread.

**Overview**

This repository highlights a curated selection of my technical writing work during my time at BigCommerce. Each piece was chosen for its significance, with me serving as the lead writer. The collection includes technical articles demonstrating my ability to simplify complex concepts and deliver clear, engaging, and accessible content for a wide range of audiences.
